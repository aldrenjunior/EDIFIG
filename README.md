# EDIFIG
EDIFIG is a final project of the programming language discipline [ECT2303], which aims to use the set of techniques seen during the program and apply to the image processing area.

In this way, we students must use the knowledge acquired in Functions, Matrices, Strings, Structured Types and Reading and Writing from/in files.

## Image File .ppm
The images to be processed by the program to be implemented are in the .ppm (portable pixel map) file format in text mode (ASCII). This file format contains the image dimensions and values of each pixel in text mode, that is, it is human-readable (can be inspected in any text editor, such as notepad).

## Project Implementation
Program Menu: The program must have a menu in text mode, so that the user can inform which processing
he wants to be applied and then enter the name of the image file that is to be processed.

Error Checking: Consider that each function must check for error conditions.

## Mandatory Functions
Open Image File and Save Image File

## Elective functions and weights associated with each of them
